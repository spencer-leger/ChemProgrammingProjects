There are several types of operators available in C/C++:

Note: this list is not exhaustive and some symbols have multiple operator definitions depending on the context, e.g. the `*` operator can be used for multiplication or to dereference a pointer. ([Pointers/references](https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects/wiki/Variable-Scope-and-Reference-Types) will be covered later in the tutorial). 

## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Action| Example|
|:---|:---|:---| 
| = | Assignment | `x = y`|
| + | Addition | `c = a+b` |
| - | Subtraction | `c = a-b` |
| * | Multiplication | `c = a*b` |
| / | Division |` c = a/b` |
| % | Modulo (remainder after division) | ` rem = a%b `|
| += | Add then assign | ` a += b` (equivalent to ` a = a+b`)| 
| -= | Subtract then assign | ` a-=b` (equivalent to `a = a-b`)|
| *= | Multiply then assign | ` a*=b` (equivalent to ` a = a*b`)|
| /= | Divide then assign | ` a /=b` (equivalent to ` a = a/b`)|
| ++ | Increment | `a = 0; a++;` (a now is 1 )|
| -- | Decrement | `a = 1; a--;` (a is now 0)|  

## Boolean Comparison Operators
| Operator | Action | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| == | Equal to | `a == b` |
| != | Not equal to | ` a != b` |
| > | Greater than | ` a > b` |
| < | Less than | ` a < b `|
| >= | Greater than or equal to | ` a >= b` |
| <= | Less than or equal to | ` a <= b` |

Note: Boolean operator statements return zero if false and non-zero if true

## Logical Operators
| Operator | Action | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| && | And | ` (a == b) && (b == c) ` |
| \|\| | Or | ` (a == b) || (b == c) ` |
| ! | Not | `!(a == b)` |
