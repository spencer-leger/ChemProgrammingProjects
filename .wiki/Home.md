# C++ Programming Tutorial in Chemistry
This tutorial is intended to touch on many, but certainly not all, of the fundamentals of C++ programming with an emphasis on quantum chemistry.  Although I hope this section will get you started, it is not a substitute for a more complete reference manual.  For more C++ language details, you may find the standard text by Josuttis [buy it](http://www.amazon.com/C-Standard-Library-Tutorial-Reference/dp/0201379260) useful or, for VT users, get it [on-line from the campus library](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/0201379260) or a decent on-line tutorial such as [this one](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/) or [this one](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial.html). 

If you are new to programming, one way to approach this tutorial is to read through the subsections of "The Fundamentals" list first, then proceed with Project #1, using the earlier material as a reference. If you are already experienced with programming, you may be able to start immediately with Project #1. If you already have experience with electronic structure theory programs, then you may be ready for the Hartee-Fock programming project or even more advanced topics.
